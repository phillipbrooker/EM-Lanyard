# EM-Lanyard
"The Ethnomethodologist's Lanyard" - a wearable device comprising a Raspberry Pi Zero and an inky pHAT e-ink display, which randomly cycles through messages that are designed to display, in text, what a person is (or will be) doing. The wittnessable, accountable features of social action are made instructive, gamified, breached.
